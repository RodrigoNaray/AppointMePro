## About the Project

AppointMePro is a production-ready SaaS platform that enables independent professionals (stylists, therapists, consultants) to manage their business operations through a secure admin dashboard while providing clients with an intuitive booking experience. It solves the problem of expensive enterprise booking systems by delivering RBAC, JWT authentication, real-time availability validation, and multi-service cart functionality at indie-friendly deployment costs.

Solo full-stack project covering architecture design, development, testing, and production deployment.

**Target Users:**
- **Professionals:** Manage services, weekly schedules, availability blocks, and bookings through a mobile-first admin panel
- **Clients:** Browse services by category, book multiple appointments in a single session with real-time availability checks

## Key Features

### Admin Panel

- Service CRUD with global category system and pricing management
- Weekly base schedule configuration with one-off availability blocks
- Real-time booking dashboard with client contact information and date filtering
- Contact info and business location settings (phone, email, address, map coordinates)
- Secure authentication with JWT HttpOnly cookies and role-based access control

### Client Experience

- Category-filtered service discovery with pagination
- Multi-service shopping cart with total duration and price calculation
- Dual authentication: email/password registration with verification + Google OAuth
- Real-time availability validation with conflict detection during booking
- Transactional email delivery via Resend API (verification, confirmation)

---

## Security & Best Practices

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT stored in HttpOnly cookies (`access_admin_token` / `access_client_token`) with `sameSite: 'lax'`
- Separate Passport.js strategies for admin and client authentication flows
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) at both frontend route level and backend middleware level
- Session invalidation on role switch to prevent concurrent access conflicts

### Security Implementation

- bcrypt password hashing with 10 rounds and salt
- CORS restricted to configured `CLIENT_URL` environment variable
- Helmet.js security headers middleware
- Prisma ORM parameterized queries (SQL injection prevention)
- Email verification tokens with expiration (24h)
- Password reset token flow with secure expiration

### Code Quality

- TypeScript strict mode enabled across both frontend and backend
- Zero `any` types enforced via ESLint rules
- Discriminated unions for type-safe auth state management
- Clean architecture pattern: routes -> controllers -> services -> Prisma
- SOLID principles applied throughout the codebase

### Testing

- 21 test files in backend (unit + integration tests with Vitest + supertest)
- 10 test files in frontend (unit tests with Vitest + @testing-library/react)
- Test coverage for auth flows, booking validation, availability conflict detection, timezone conversion utilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20+
- pnpm v9+
- PostgreSQL v17+ (or Supabase account)
- Git

### Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RodrigoNaray/AppointMe.git
cd AppointMe
pnpm install
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
cd backend && npx prisma migrate dev && npx prisma db seed && pnpm create:admin
cd .. && npm run dev
```

## Challenges Faced

- **Cross-Session Authentication:** RBAC route guards (`AdminRoute`, `ClientRoute`) plus backend cookie invalidation on role switch to prevent privilege escalation after logout
- **Safari iOS Cookies:** Migrated from `sameSite: 'strict'` to `'lax'` to resolve cross-site cookie blocking on Safari mobile
- **Booking Conflicts:** Atomic Prisma transaction with `findFirst()` + `create()` and database-level unique constraints to prevent double-booking
